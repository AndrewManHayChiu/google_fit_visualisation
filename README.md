# Visualising Google Fit Data

Here I attempt to visualise a year's worth of activity using data collected by Google Fit.

### Google Fit

Google Fit is an app that tracks data from the phone, including:

* Steps
* Weight
* Calories
* Distance
* Location
* Speed

Within the app, it presents daily statistics and time-series through a dashboard.

The data can be downloaded from Google quite easily. See (here)[https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3024190?hl=en]
