# Visualising Google Fit Data

Here I attempt to visualise a year's worth of activity using data collected by Google Fit.

The visualisations are produced in R. The R script is *google_fit_viz.R*.

### Google Fit

Google Fit is an app that tracks data from the phone, including:

* Steps
* Weight
* Calories
* Distance
* Location
* Speed

Within the app, it presents daily statistics and time-series through a dashboard.

The data can be downloaded from Google quite easily. See <https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3024190?hl=en>.

Below is the second draft of my visualisation.

The inner ring is the range of temperature in my home city, Melbourne, Australia.

The middle ring is a bar plot of the number of steps I took within each day.

The outer ring is a circle chart of the number of steps I took at 15 minute intervals throughout the day.
